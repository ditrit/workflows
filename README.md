# workflows

This is a very first implementation for TOSCA 1.1 explicit workflows.

The purpose is to implement TOSCA declarative workflows defined at node type and relationship type level as described in the OASIS normative document 
[TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML Version 1.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1.pdf).

Workflow definition is parsed into a simple rule based RETE like engine.
Engine uses a set of workers which insert facts into RETE rules and execute operations.
Workers are sateless and coordination is provided using LINDA coordination language primitives.
Consul is used as storage backend (used for facts and RETE rules) and as the Tuple-Space used by workers.

## Resiliency and high availibility
- No more facts distribution : each worker launch a thread for each fact of the instance whose status is set as ready in the Space. 
- Linda coordination provides distribution of operations whatever the number of workers.
- Consul provides high availibility, resiliency and coherency at Space level. 

## The exemple 
- Workflows implemented are standard `install and uninstall TOSCA workflow as defined in ยง "7.4.2 Weaving improvements" of the normative document.
- The Model used as exemple describe connections between 4 nodes (`A-->B B-->D D-->C and A -->C ), each one node being hosted onto an other node (A is hosted on srvA, B is hosted on srvB, C is hosted on srvC and D is hosted on D). 
- Default scaling is used on several nodes. 19 real nodes are built when the 'install' workflow is executed for an instance of the model.

## Running the example

1. Prerequisite :
   - An up and running consul cluster (tested with 3 consul servers)
   - A set of servers for workflow workers (tested with 3 servers). 
   - A server for manager (can be one of the workers)
2. Installation :
   - Install a consul agent and join to the cluster for each worker and the manager.
   - For each workflow worker :
      - copy 'workers/watches.json' '/etc/consul.d' (consul config directory). 
      - Copy 'workers/wdt.py' into '/usr/local/bin'
      - Copy 'utils/linda.py' into '/usr/local/bin'
   - For the manager :
      - copy 'manager/{upload.py, run.py}' into '/usr/local/bin'.
      - copy 'utils/*' into '/usr/local/bin'.
3. Execute :
   - Parse and upload a ditrit component library (actually just TOSCA root normative types) : <pre>python upload.py library normative.yaml</pre>
   - Parse and upload an application model : <pre>python upload.py model test_model.yaml un_model</pre>
   - Instanciate a deployment from model  : <pre>pyhton run.py instanciate un_model une_instance</pre>
   - Launch the workflow from the manager : <pre>python run.py workflow install un_model une_instance"</pre>
   - Watch execution from each workflow worker <pre>tail -f /opt/execs</pre>
4. Shutdown or create workers or consul server members during execution and verify it's still working.
