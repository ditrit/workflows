# workflows

This is a very first implementation for TOSCA 1.1 explicit workflows.

The purpose is to implement TOSCA declarative workflows defined at node type and relationship type level as described in the OASIS normative document 
[TOSCA Simple Profile in YAML Version 1.1](http://docs.oasis-open.org/tosca/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML/v1.1/TOSCA-Simple-Profile-YAML-v1.1.pdf).

Workflow definition is parsed into a simple rule based RETE like engine. 
Orchestration is launched simply inserting facts (nodes and relationships instances) into the RETE network.
Both facts and RETE rules are stored into Consul. 

## The exemple 
- Workflows implemented are standard `install and uninstall TOSCA workflow as defined in ยง "7.4.2 Weaving improvements" of the normative document.
- Facts used as exemple describe connections between 4 nodes : [`A-->B B-->D D-->C and A -->C], each node being hosted onto a 'srv' node (A is hosted on srvA, B is hosted on srvB, C is hosted on srvC and D is hosted on D). 

## Running the example

1. Prerequisite :
   - A working consul cluster (tested with 3 consul servers)
   - A set of workflow workers (tested with 3 servers). 
   - A manager server (can be one of the workflow server)
   - can just copy exec_workflow.py and utils.py on the other ones. 
2. Installation :
   - Install a consul agent and join it to the cluster for each worker and the manager.
   - Copy 'workers/workflow_watch.json' into the consul config directory for each workflow worker
   - Copy 'workers/.py' into '/usr/local/bin' for each workflow server
   - copy 'manager/*' on the manager.
2. Parse and upload the exemple on the manager: <pre>python data_to_consul.py normative.yaml</pre>
3. Launch the workflow from the manager : <pre>consul kv put exec-workflow "{'name': 'install'}"</pre>
4. Watch execution from each workflow worker <pre>tail -f /opt/execs</pre>
5. Shutdown one of the worker during execution and verify it's still working.
